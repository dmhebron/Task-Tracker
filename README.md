For this task tracker I ran into several issues:
1. Figuring out what html was needed to display on the page
2. Where the js elements would fit into the html file
3. Creating the edit and delete button in js
4. Getting all the buttons to work
5. Trying to save the data entered into a local storage file
6. Styling the buttons I created in the js file

What research I did:
1. I watched this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eFwtaZf6zc
2. I also watched this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkESyVB4oUw
3. I reached out to my mentor who provided this resource https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushMessageData/json
4. Eloquent Javascript

What would I do differently?
1. I would try to build the logic in a way that makes more sense to me
2. I would spend more time breaking down the assignment
3. I would figure out how to incorporate the txt or json file
